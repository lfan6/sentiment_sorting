FE-595 Sentiment Sorting Assignment

There are 3 main functions to this file; merge_files, best_worst, and most_common. A description of what each function does is included in the py file. All the scripts can be run from the main function. To use this project, you will need any number of csv files that are in the format as we established in the previous assignment (2 columns with a company name and purpose), as well as the file path to where they are saved as. *** Note - if you wanted to use other data, the project would also work so long as the data in the second column is of type str *** The script will ask you how many files you wish to merge, where these files are located, and the names of each file. After entering the file names, the project will run using the data provided. The output will be the best and worst company based on compound polarity scores, as well as the 10 most common words and how often they are used in the universe of company purposes.
